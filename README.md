## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of cervical cancer based on various risk factors and medical history. Using a dataset containing attributes related to demographic information, behavioral habits, and medical history, we will perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and verify the appliance of PCA and Apriori association rules.

## Files

- [`archive`](archive): Source data files and generated ones (original and cleaned datasets).
- [`eda&cleaning.ipynb`](eda&cleaning.ipynb): Initial exploratory data analysis notebook (Questions 1 to 7)
- [`pca.ipynb`](pca.ipynb): Principal components analysis (Question 8)
- [`apriori.ipynb`](apriori.ipynb): Association rules using Apriori algorithm (Question 9)
- [`findings&conclusions.ipynb`](findings&conclusions.ipynb): Final findings and conclusions about the entire process.

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or need further assistance.

## Recommendations

While using Python, we highly recommend using a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) as good practice.
