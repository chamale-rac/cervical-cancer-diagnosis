    "The analysis revealed that individuals aged 13-20 are often associated with having no STDs, no diagnoses, and short-term use (0-2 years) of hormonal contraceptives or IUDs, with a support of 12.4%, confidence between 57.24% and 60.14%, and a lift of 2.77. These patterns indicate that young individuals frequently use contraceptives for short durations and have fewer health issues, highlighting the importance of targeted health interventions and education for this demographic to promote safe contraceptive use and STD prevention. The strong metrics underscore the reliability and impact of these findings."
